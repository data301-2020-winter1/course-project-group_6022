The gold standard of a project like this would be [this](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)
#questions to answer
#number of hospitalized patients + chart
#number of ICU visits + chart
#number of intubations + chart

#big one -> heatmap with neighbourhood infections over time since first reported case
